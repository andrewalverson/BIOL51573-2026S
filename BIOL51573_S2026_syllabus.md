BIOL 51573: Practical Programming for Biologists
================

## Instructor

Dr. Andrew Alverson, Department of Biological Sciences: <aja@uark.edu>

## Course delivery

Live class meetings will take place MW 9:40 – 10:55 AM in SCEN 606.
Course content is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewalverson/BIOL51573-2026S).

## Office Hours

Send an email to set up an in-person or Zoom meeting.

## Disclaimer

The information contained in this syllabus does not constitute a
contractual agreement. The course content and grading policy may be
changed at the discretion of the instructor. All assigned work is
required of each student.

## Purpose of the course

As vast amounts of genomic and other biological data accumulate,
biologists require the skills to manipulate and analyze large datasets
in an efficient way. This course will provide hands-on instruction on
the fundamentals of biological computing. Although most examples center
around the analysis of genomic data, the skills taught in this course
can be applied to any dataset, biological or otherwise. Students will
learn how to: - use a Unix- or Linux-based work station, - navigate and
work from the command line, - archive and document one’s work with
version control software - learn how to program in Python, a popular
scripting language for biological applications

## Grade componenets

| Item                  | Percent |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Exercises/assignments | 60%     |
| DataCamp assignments  | 40%     |

Letter grades will be based on the following scale:

- A \>= 90%
- B \>= 80%
- C \>= 70%
- D \>= 60%
- F \<= 60%

No extra credit points will be available. **Under no circumstances will
any grade be altered for any reason except in the case of a grading
error.** You have exactly 7 days from the time the work was returned to
request a re-evaluation. At that point, the entire quiz/lab/assignment
will be re-graded. Mistakes will be corrected, including any that could
result in a net decrease in your grade.

are lots of web resources available for all the topics we’ll be
covering.

## University policies and calendar

Please review carefully the [official university calendar for important
dates](https://catalog.uark.edu/generalinfo/academiccalendar/)

### Academic Honesty

Academic dishonesty includes any effort to circumvent the evaluation
procedures of the course to improve a grade for yourself or other
students (cheating). Cheating includes but is not limited to
unauthorized examination of written materials (e.g., notes, neighbor’s
paper) during an exam or quiz, misrepresentation of the cause of an
absence during an exam, submitting the work of another (partially or
entirely) as ones own, and alteration of an assignment or quiz to be
submitted for re-grading. You are encouraged to report academic
dishonesty. Anonymity will be protected if requested. There is no excuse
for academic dishonesty, so if we believe that a student has cheated,
and we have any supporting evidence, we will report the accusation and
the evidence to the Office of Judicial Affairs immediately, with the
recommendation of an **F** grade in the course. If you have any
questions of what constitutes academic dishonesty, please ask us or
refer to the brochure entitled *Academic Honesty* available from the
division of Student Services: <https://honesty.uark.edu/policy/>

Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with and
abide by the University’s Academic Integrity Policy, which may be found
[here](https://provost.uark.edu/academic_initiatives.php). Students with
questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or
assignment should contact their instructor immediately.

### Students with Disabilities

University of Arkansas Academic Policy 1520.10 requires that students
with disabilities are provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their
equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and
require accommodations, contact the instructor privately within two
weeks of the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for
necessary classroom adjustments. You must first verify your eligibility
for these through the Center for Educational Access Room 104 in the
Arkansas Union. Contact 479–575–3104 or visit
[https://cea.uark.edu/](http://cea.uark.edu/) for more information on
registration procedures.

### Emergency Preparedness

Many types of emergencies can occur on campus; instructions for specific
emergencies such as severe weather, active shooter, or fire can be found
at
[https://safety.uark.edu/emergency-preparedness/](http://emergency.uark.edu/)

### Violence / Active Shooter (Think ‘CADD’)

- **CALL:** 9-1-1
- **AVOID:** If possible, self-evacuate to a safe area outside the
  building. Follow directions of police officers.
- **DENY:** Barricade the door with desk, chairs, bookcases or any
  items. Move to a place inside the room where you are not visible. Turn
  off the lights and remain quiet. Remain there until told by police it
  is safe.
- **DEFEND:** Use chairs, desks, cell phones or whatever is immediately
  available to distract and/or defend yourself and others from attack.

### Inclement Weather Policy

When the University has officially canceled classes because of inclement
weather this class will not meet. For information regarding whether the
university is closed for any reason use the following sources:

- See the inclement weather web site at
  <https://safety.uark.edu/inclement-weather/>
- Call 479-575-7000 or university switchboard at 575-2000 for recorded
  announcements about closings
- Listen to KUAF Radio (91.3 FM) or other local radio and TV stations
  for announcements.

### Tape-recording and/or any Other Form of Electronic Capturing

Tape-recording and/or any other form of electronic capturing of lectures
is expressly forbidden. State common law and federal copyright law
protect my syllabus and lectures. They are my own original expression
and I often record my lectures at the same time that I deliver them in
order to secure protection. Whereas you are authorized to take notes in
class thereby creating a derivative work from my lecture, the
authorization extends only to making one set of notes for your own
personal use and no other use. You are not authorized to record
lectures, to provide your notes to anyone else, or to make any
commercial use of them without express prior permission from the
instructors.

Persons authorized to take notes for the Center for Educational Access,
for the benefit of students registered with the Center, will be
permitted to do so, but such use still is limited to personal,
non-commercial use. Similarly, you are permitted to reproduce notes for
a student in this class who has missed class due to authorized travel,
absence due to illness, etc. However, to be clear, any class notes must
not be sold or made available for any commercial use.

Recorded lectures will be available on Blackboard for viewing or
downloading. You may not under any circumstance share these videos or
post them, including abbreviated clips of these videos, on the internet,
including social media.

### Sale or Electronic Distribution of Class Notes

There are companies that will try to lure you into selling the notes you
take in this class. Don’t let these companies take advantage of you.
Selling class notes, exams, or exam-related content to any commercial
service is a violation of the instructor’s intellectual property rights
and/or copyright law as well as a violation of the U of A’s academic
integrity policy. Continued enrollment in this class signifies intent to
abide by this policy.
